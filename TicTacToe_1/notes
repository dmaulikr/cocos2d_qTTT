receive
if (messagetype is action )
-->update objects
-->check state of objects for cyclic, which then calls a modified version of updateobjectswithcycle
-->check state for collapse
-->set state from waiting to observing (so the touch is handled differently) or set state to playing
if (messagetype is observation)
if state is not waiting, wtf? if im playing, i shouldn't be getting an observation from the other player
--> update objects with what was chosen
-->state is still waiting





draw
check which objects and draw a line from the entangled marks,

check for cycles.. things can be
    a collapse
    a cycle
    no cycle
    
    if cycle... check for collapse
        we know there's a cycle.. so...
